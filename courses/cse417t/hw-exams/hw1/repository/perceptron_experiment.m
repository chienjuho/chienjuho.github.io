function [ num_iters bounds] = perceptron_experiment ( N, d, num_exp )
%   Code for running the perceptron experiment in HW1
%
%   Inputs: N is the number of training examples
%           d is the dimensionality of each example (before adding the 1)
%           num_exp is the number of times to repeat the experiment
%   Outputs: num_iters is the # of iterations PLA takes for each sample
%            bounds is the theoretical bound on the # of iterations
%              for each time running the experiment
%      (both the outputs should be num_exp long)
