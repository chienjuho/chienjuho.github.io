<h4>ANNOUNCEMENTS</h4>

<ul>
<li>Welcome to CSE 518A: Human-in-the-Loop Computation!</li>
<!--
<li>Here is the <a href="http://piazza.com/wustl/fall2021/cse518a">Piazza page</a> for this course. </li>
-->
</ul>

<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>

This course is an exploration of the opportunities and challenges of human-in-the-loop computation, an emerging field that examines how humans and computers can work together to solve problems neither can solve alone yet. We will explore ways in which techniques from machine learning, game theory, optimization, online behavioral social science, and human-computer interactions can be used to model and analyze human-in-the-loop systems such as crowdsourcing markets, prediction markets, and user-generated content platforms. We will also look into recent developments in the interactions between humans and AIs, such as learning with the presence of strategic behavior and ethical issues in AI systems.

</ul>

<h4>TEXTBOOKS</h4>

There is no required textbook for this course. Instead, we will post reading materials on the course website.

<h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>

CSE 247, ESE 326, Math 233, and Math 309. Students are expected to have a strong background in calculus, probability, and linear algebra. Students should also be comfortable with computer science concepts through at least a class in data structures and algorithms.

<h4>SCHEDULE, READING, AND ASSIGNMENTS</h4>

The schedule is tentative and might change as the semester progresses.<br/><br/>

For more technical topics, I tend to choose one of the earlier papers that require less background knowledge. 
If you find some topic interesting, you are encouraged to explore the follow-up papers 
(<a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> would be a good place to start search for papers).
<br/><br/>

Some papers are behind the paywall. 
You should be able to access them within the WashU network (use VPN if you are outside of campus). 
If you still cannot access the paper, you can search the paper title online. 
In most cases, the authors keep copies of papers on their own website.
