<context-title> Overview </context-title>
<div id="line"/><br/>
<context-body>

There is great untapped potential for foundational mathematical research to influence and shape the future of human computation. Indeed there is already a small literature on the use of mathematical models to analyze and design human computation systems including crowdsourcing markets, prediction markets, and user-generated content sites.  However, we are far from having a full systematic understanding of the possibilities and limitations of human computation.
<br/><br/>

This workshop will bring together researchers across disciplines to discuss the future of research on the mathematical foundations of human computation, with particular emphasis on the ways in which theorists can learn from the existing empirical literature on human computation and the ways in which applied and empirical work on human computation can benefit from mathematical foundations.
<br/><br/>

<context-title> Topics of Interests </context-title>
<div id="line" /><br/>
<context-body>
Questions of interest include but are not limited to:
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Can we rigorously model what a human can compute? Can we quantify the computational power of a crowd? How?</li>
    <li>What are useful mathematical models and complexity measures for human computation? </li>
    <li>Is it possible to model user behavior accurately enough to yield formal guarantees about the performance of crowdsourcing systems that are useful in practice? Are there systematic deviations from standard theories in online users' behavior? </li>
    <li>How can we design humanly-usable algorithms and protocols?</li>
    <li>Does the computational power of a crowd scale nonlinearly? In other words, is the power of a crowd more than the sum of its constituent humans? </li>
    <li>What are the core technical challenges faced when designing human computation mechanisms?</li>
    <li>What is the best way to solve a problem with a crowd? How should tasks be divided up and assigned among individuals? For example, should the crowd be organized as a hierarchy or should every individual have equal influence?</li>
</ul>

<context-title> Paper Submission </context-title>
<div id="line" /><br/>
<context-body>

We solicit contributed papers of two types:<br/><br/>

(1) Research papers report the results of new, recent, or ongoing research.
<br/><br/>

(2) Position papers describe the authors' vision of how the mathematical
foundations of human computation should evolve as a field. 
<br/><br/>

Papers may be up to three pages long with an optional fourth page containing
references only. Please use any single column format and a font size of at
least 11 pt.  Accepted papers will be made available on the workshop
website. However, the workshop will have no archival proceedings, meaning
contributors are free to publish their results subsequently in archival
journals or conferences. We also welcome submissions of work that has
recently (within the last year) been published in other conferences.
Simultaneous submission to HCOMP is not allowed.  Papers should be submitted via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=math-hcomp2016">EasyChair</a> and do not need to be anonymized.
<br/><br/>

Submission site: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=math-hcomp2016
">EasyChair</a><br/>
Deadline for submissions: Monday, August 1, 2016 <br/>
Notification of acceptance: on or around Friday, August 26, 2016

<!--
Submissions are invited from researchers working in relevant areas of computer science theory, artificial intelligence, systems, human computer interaction, economics, behavioral economics and psychology, or any other related fields.  More information on the workshop format, invited speakers, and opportunities for submission will be available soon.

<div id='manuel' style="display:none">
In this talk, I present a new automata-theoretic model of the brain, based on known psychology and neurophysiology.  The intention of the model  is to bring CS ideas and understanding to bear on the kinds of computations humans can and can't do in their heads.  The model is designed to give insight into human computation in much the same way that finite automata theory gives insight into what processor hardware can and can't do, and Turing machines give insight into what general purpose computers can and can't do.<br/><br/>

This work has applications to password generation, wherein humans - working entirely in their head -  transform website names into (distinct random-looking) passwords.<br/><br/>

<div id="adam-toggle" onclick="javascript:toggle_messege('adam', 'adam-toggle')"> Abstract + </div>
<div id='adam' style="display:none">
Human involvement is still essential to Unsupervised Learning and Exploratory Data Analysis. Why do algorithms fail where humans succeed? We present a model that is intended to capture both how humans perform unsupervised learning and how computers might benefit from a more human-like approach. The model, which we call “meta-unsupervised-learning,” incorporates prior related or unrelated learning problems to inform decisions.  We present simple agnostic models and algorithms illustrating how the meta approach circumvents impossibility results for novel "meta" problems such as meta-clustering, meta-outlier-removal, meta-feature-selection, and meta-embedding. We also present empirical results showing how the meta approach improves over standard techniques for problems such as outlier removal, choosing a clustering algorithm, and a number of clusters. We also train an unsupervised neural network that learns from prior supervised classification problems drawn from learning problems at <a href="http://openml.org">openml.org</a>. <br/><br/>

<div id='jaime' style="display:none">
Many of the chunks of time we have in a day are too short to bother trying to use productively. Think of the time you spend waiting for a meeting to start, riding in an elevator, or standing in line. We try to defrag our time by booking meetings with ourselves, turning off our phones, and taking email vacations. But there is another way. Rather than fighting fragmentation by changing how we work, we can embrace it by changing our tasks to fit the way we actually do work. We call this microproductivity, in which large productivity tasks are broken down into a series of smaller microtasks. The component microtasks can then be completed by the task owner via selfsourcing, or by the crowd via crowdsourcing. The transformation of work into microwork will change when and how people work, and enable individuals and automated processes to efficiently and easily complete complex tasks.
